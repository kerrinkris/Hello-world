# Hello-world
CS50 Introduction to Computer Science
I'm a retired New York City Fire Lieutenant living in Thailand. I've been a computer dilettante since the seventies.  
It's been fifteen years since I've worked in computer science. I used to program in C, a little.  I'm now seeking
to upgrade my skills.
